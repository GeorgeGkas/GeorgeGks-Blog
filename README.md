#GeorgeGks Blog

This is an experiment project. The goal behind it is to create a blog that will serve me in the upcoming years. However, the main goal is to familiarize myself with a brand new technologies like:

- ServerSide Javascript (NodeJs)
- Express.js and Pug Template Language
- Work-flow Automation with Gulp.js
- Better understanding of Scss, the css preprocessor and it's design patterns
- Npm usage
- DRY principle
- UI/UX design

**Caution:** This project has not designed for publication. Although, you can run the project locally from npm. If you find any issues you can make a **PR** *(pull request)* or write an issue.
